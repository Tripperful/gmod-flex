Flex layout panel for Garry's mod

Use it to your liking, I don't care

Provided as is, any bug reports or fixes are not required but appreciated

Hold down CTRL+SHIFT+C to open the inspector (a thing similar to one you'll find in Chrome dev tools), it will allow you to view/change any properties of any flex panels on the screen. Hold down shift to enable panel selection. Left click to select currently highlighted panel. Right click to deselect. This thing is meant to be useful during debugging and prototyping of your UI

The inspector itself serves as an example of how approximately to work with this shit, take a look at the code basically, I'm too lazy to document it atm

Here's approximately what it looks like: https://youtu.be/NXE3vxgcleA
